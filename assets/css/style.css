/* CSS Syntax Explanation */

/* CSS Rule: The entire block of the following code is a CSS rule. 
   It defines the styles that will be applied to elements selected by the selector. */
/* body { */
    /* Declaration: Each line inside the curly braces is a declaration.
       It consists of a property and its value, separated by a colon. */

    /* color: #39a6b2; */
    /* Declaration example:
                       Property: color
                       Property Value: #39a6b2
                       This sets the text color for the body element. */

    /* font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; */
    /* Declaration example:
                                                   Property: font-family
                                                   Property Value: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
                                                   This sets the font family for text in the body element.
                                                   It tries Helvetica first, then Arial, and falls back to a generic sans-serif font if neither is available. */
/* } */

/* Selector: The part before the curly braces (body) is the selector.
   It identifies the HTML elements to which the CSS rule applies. In this case, it targets the <body> tag of the HTML document. */

/* Property: Refers to a predefined style characteristic, like 'color' or 'font-family'. 
   These are aspects of the element you want to style. */

/* Property Value: Specifies the style settings for the chosen property.
   For example, '#39a6b2' is a color value in hexadecimal format. */

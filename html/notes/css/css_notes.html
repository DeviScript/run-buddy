        <h2>Additional Notes on CSS Box Model</h2>
        <p><strong>CSS Box Model:</strong> All HTML elements can be represented by a rectangular box, known as the CSS
            box. The CSS Box Model visually represents the properties of the CSS box, which include content, padding,
            border, and margins, layered like an onion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> The innermost box inside the CSS box that contains text and nested elements.
                Its size is determined by the 'height' and 'width' properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Inside margin of the CSS box, surrounding the content. The size of padding can
                be specified for each of the four sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Border:</strong> Surrounds the padding and lies between the margin's inner edge. Sides, size,
                and styles can be modified (e.g., border-bottom, border-style, border-top-color). Requires line weight,
                style, and color for rendering.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Similar to padding but outside the box. Creates space outside the box,
                affecting nearby HTML elements. Specified using top, right, bottom, left values.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Detailed Explanation of CSS Cascading and !important</h2>
        <p>CSS cascading is a fundamental concept where styles are applied based on specific rules, determining which
            styles take precedence in cases of conflict. This mechanism allows for flexibility and control in styling
            HTML documents.</p>

        <p>An example of cascading is when we have multiple &lt;a&gt; elements in different parts of a document, like
            the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. We might want to style &lt;a&gt; elements in the &lt;header&gt;
            differently from those in the &lt;footer&gt;. This can be achieved by using more specific CSS selectors. For
            instance, 'header a { color: yellow; }' will style all &lt;a&gt; elements within the &lt;header&gt; yellow,
            while 'footer a { color: blue; }' will do the same for &lt;a&gt; elements in the &lt;footer&gt;.</p>

        <h3>Understanding !important in CSS</h3>
        <p>The `!important` rule in CSS is a powerful yet often misused feature. It's used to make a particular style
            declaration override all other conflicting declarations, regardless of their specificity or location in the
            stylesheet. For example, if we have 'a { color: green; }' and later 'a { color: red !important; }', all
            &lt;a&gt; elements will be red, even though green is declared first.</p>

        <p>However, overusing `!important` can lead to maintenance challenges. It disrupts the natural flow of cascading
            and can make debugging styles difficult, as it forces a style regardless of any other rules defined
            elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>Key Factors in CSS Cascading</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> CSS gives priority to more specific selectors over general ones. For
                example, a style declared for 'body h1' will override a style for 'h1' because it's more specific,
                targeting only &lt;h1&gt; elements inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.</li>
            <li><strong>Source Order:</strong> The order in which styles are declared in CSS also matters. If two styles
                with the same specificity are declared, the one that appears later in the CSS file will take precedence.
                For instance, if 'h1 { color: red; }' appears before 'h1 { color: blue; }', the &lt;h1&gt; elements will
                be blue.</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent. For
                example, if 'font-family' is set on the body element, it's inherited by all child elements unless
                overridden by a more specific rule.</li>
        </ul>

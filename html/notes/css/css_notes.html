        <h2>Additional Notes on CSS Box Model</h2>
        <p><strong>CSS Box Model:</strong> All HTML elements can be represented by a rectangular box, known as the CSS
            box. The CSS Box Model visually represents the properties of the CSS box, which include content, padding,
            border, and margins, layered like an onion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> The innermost box inside the CSS box that contains text and nested elements.
                Its size is determined by the 'height' and 'width' properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Inside margin of the CSS box, surrounding the content. The size of padding can
                be specified for each of the four sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Border:</strong> Surrounds the padding and lies between the margin's inner edge. Sides, size,
                and styles can be modified (e.g., border-bottom, border-style, border-top-color). Requires line weight,
                style, and color for rendering.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Similar to padding but outside the box. Creates space outside the box,
                affecting nearby HTML elements. Specified using top, right, bottom, left values.</li>
        </ul>
